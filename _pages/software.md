# Code Release

## ðŸ¦‹ [Reconfigurable Butterfly Accelerator for Attention-based Neural Networks (MICRO'22)](https://github.com/SamsungLabs/Butterfly_Acc)

We propose an algorithm and hardware co-design approach to accelerate Attention-based Neural Networks (AttNNs) with Butterfly Sparsity.

This work is awarded three Artifacts Badges (**Artifact Available**, **Artifact Functional**, and **Results Reproduced**).
The code mainly contains:
 
- Hardware Verilog implementation of a butterfly AttNN accelerator.
- Sofware PyTorch implementation of an efficient AttNN (*FABNet*).
- Automatic scripts to validate hardware functionality, measure power consumption and generate bitstream.

## ðŸŒŸ [FPGA-based Acceleration for Dropout-based Bayesian Neural Networks (DAC'23)](https://github.com/os-hxfan/BayesNN_FPGA)

We propose multiple algorithm and hardware optimizations to accelerate MCD-based BayesNNs and Maskembles.
The code mainly contains:
 
- Hardware HLS implementation for the proposed FPGA-based accelerators.
- Sofware PyTorch implementation of Dropout-based BayesNNs.
- Automatic scripts for HLS prediction, synthesis and implmentation.

## ðŸ’« [Sparsity-Aware Dynamic and Static Scheduling for Sparse Multi-DNN Workloads (MICRO'23)](https://github.com/SamsungLabs/Sparse-Multi-DNN-Scheduling)

We propose a dynamic and static scheduling algorithm for sparse Multi-DNN workloads.
This work is under review for Artifact Evaluation of MICRO'23. 
The code mainly contains:

- Sparse Multi-DNN Benchmark: Collections of diverse sparsified (SparseML) Convolutional NNs (CNNs) and Attention-based NNs (AttNNs) from three distinct applications, namely visual perception, personal assistant, and hand tracking.
- Simulation-based Evaluation Infrastructure: Seamless integration with PyTorch to evaluate the performance of different multi-DNN scheduling approaches.
- Hardware and Software Prototypes of our Static and Dynamic Scheduler: FPGA-based implementation to obtain resource estimation of hardware resources.

## ðŸ’« [Prior 2022](https://github.com/os-hxfan)

Check my [GitHub HomePage](https://github.com/os-hxfan) for details. We have open-sourced a series of code, such as  software and hardware implementations for FPT'18, ASAP'19, DAC'21 and so on.
